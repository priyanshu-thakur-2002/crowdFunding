Smart Contract for MTC Token Donation System
Description

This project is a smart contract that allows people to donate money and receive MTC tokens in return.

The smart contract is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a decentralized platform for building and deploying decentralized applications (DApps). This means that the contract is stored on a distributed network of computers, rather than a centralized server, making it more secure and transparent.
Usage

To use the smart contract, users can send Ethereum (ETH) to the contract address, and in return, they will receive MTC tokens. The exchange rate between ETH and MTC tokens is fixed at a certain rate, which is determined by the contract owner.

The contract owner can also reset the exchange rate.

To interact with the smart contract, users can use a web3-enabled wallet, such as MetaMask or MyEtherWallet, and connect it to the Ethereum network. They can then send ETH to the contract address using the wallet interface, and the MTC tokens will be automatically sent back to their wallet.
Installation

To deploy the smart contract, you will need to have a working Ethereum node, such as Geth or Parity, and a compatible development environment, such as Truffle or Remix. You will also need to have some knowledge of Solidity, the programming language used to write Ethereum smart contracts.

for seeing the working of smart contract, user can simple copy the code and paste in remix IDE.
